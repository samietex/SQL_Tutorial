### Prerequisites

- **SQL Server**: Make sure you have SQL Server installed. You can download the free SQL Server Express Edition for practice.

### Installation

1. Install SQL Server Express Edition.
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Core Concepts

### 1. SQL Basics

- SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
- Start constructing your `SELECT` statement to retrieve data from SQL Server.
- Filter out unwanted data using the `WHERE` clause.
- Order your result set using the `ORDER BY` clause.

### 2. Joins

- Understand different types of joins:
  - `INNER JOIN`
  - `LEFT OUTER JOIN`
  - `RIGHT OUTER JOIN`
  - `FULL OUTER JOIN`
- Retrieve data from multiple tables using joins.

### 3. Aggregates and Grouping

- Use aggregate functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.
- Group and summarize data using the `GROUP BY` clause.
- Apply filters to grouped data with the `HAVING` clause.
